        <p>For this assignment, I decided to make a simple step stool.</p>
        
        <p>First, I modelled it out in Fusion. For the thickness, I used 14.5mm as it was what I had used previously</p>
        <div class="my-3" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;">
          <iframe
            src="https://a360.co/4kSda07"
            width="100%"
            height="100%"
            frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen
            loading="lazy">
          </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>Next, I created the layout of the pieces to be exported as a DXF file to VCarve Pro. I added dogbones at this stage as it allows me to reduce the size of the dogbones, giving the stool a cleaner look</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
          <img src="{{ 'images/2DCNC/layout.png' | relative_url }}" 
              alt="Design Layout" 
              class="modal-img">
        </div>

        <p>Next, I tried it out in VCarve Pro Trial to see how it would look like. After doing all the necessary stuff, this was the result</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
          <img src="{{ 'images/2DCNC/vcarve.png' | relative_url }}" 
              alt="Design in VCarve" 
              class="modal-img">
        </div>

        <p>Next, I went to get it cut out. After everything was good, the cutting commenced</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
          <img src="{{ 'images/2DCNC/cutting.png' | relative_url }}" 
              alt="Cutting in Progress" 
              class="modal-img">
        </div>

        <p>After cleaning up the area, I am left with my cutout pieces</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
          <img src="{{ 'images/2DCNC/cutout.png' | relative_url }}" 
              alt="Step Stool Parts" 
              class="modal-img">
        </div>

        <p>After a little sanding for the edges, I am left with my step stool!</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
          <img src="{{ 'images/2DCNC/step stool.jpeg' | relative_url }}" 
              alt="Step Stool Parts" 
              class="modal-img">
        </div>

        <p>While I was satisfied by the final product, I reflected on what could be improved. One main issue I saw was that the step stool can be a bit wobbly and doesn't feel very stable when I am standing on it..
          What I could have done was to add a back support for stability or made the steps longer, with the indents deeper, so that it would be more stable. However, I am still satisfied with the outcome.
